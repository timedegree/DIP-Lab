My Digital Image Processing course assignments

## Content

- **ex1**: Perform basic image operations including loading, displaying, converting to grayscale, and saving images.
- **ex2**: Implement image cropping, noise injection, gamma/log correction, and binarization for contrast enhancement.
- **ex3**: Explore geometric transformations (scaling, rotation) and multi-scale representations with Gaussian pyramids.
- **ex4**: Apply histogram equalization techniques on both grayscale and RGB images for contrast adjustment.
- **ex5**: Implement spatial domain filtering techniques including Gaussian, Median, Sobel, Roberts, Prewitt, Canny, and Gabor filters for image enhancement and edge detection.
- **ex6**: Explore frequency domain filtering using Ideal/Butterworth/Gaussian low-pass and high-pass filters with FFT for image smoothing and sharpening.
